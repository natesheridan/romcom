# Mod1 Paired Project
## RomCom
#### Contributors: Nate Sheridan & [Tony Hsu](https://github.com/tonydhsu)


This project uses the Document Object Model, otherwise known as the DOM to manipulate different Romance novel covers along with titles and descriptions.  Using JavaScript the user is able to view random book covers along with random titles and descriptions.  There is also a function that allows the user to create a new romance cover with the user's own input, save a cover, and view all saved covers.
